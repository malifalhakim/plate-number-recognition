# Image Processing Modules :camera:

This repository contains a collection of image processing modules for data science projects. :gear:

## Description :clipboard:

The image processing modules in this repository provide various functionalities for manipulating and analyzing images. These modules are designed to be used in data science projects that involve image data.

### Augmentation :rocket:

The `augmentation.py` file in this repository provides functions for augmenting images. Image augmentation is a technique commonly used in computer vision tasks to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. It helps improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models.

The `augmentation.py` file includes functions for performing common image augmentation operations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. These functions can be used to generate augmented images from a given dataset, which can then be used for training machine learning models.

### Image Processing :art:

The `image_processing.py` file in this repository contains functions for performing various image processing operations. These operations include filtering, smoothing, edge detection, and color manipulation.

The `image_processing.py` file provides a set of functions that can be used to preprocess images before feeding them into machine learning models or to enhance the visual quality of images for display purposes.
